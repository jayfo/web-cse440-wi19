00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.760
Oh shoot! I completely forgot about my homework!

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.080
Hey man did you finish the homework?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.640
I played games for a little bit too long, so no.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.200
Dang, that's rough.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
Remember class, you've gotta study because you have your final exam coming up next Wednesday.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840
Oh hey, what are you doing?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.900
Oh, it's this brand new app I downloaded called Melon. It helps me keep track of all my tasks

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.940
and organize them so I don't procrastinate.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.780
That actually sounds pretty good. I should try that.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.160
Hmm, procrastinated tasks. I mean I have put off calling my mom for a while so I'll do that one.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.220
And I should really exercise some more.  Oh that's on here.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.440
Oh yeah, I have that final exam next week too.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.040
Melon also offers a task planning feature to help users break down large, hard to approach

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.780
tasks into several smaller steps so that they're easier to work on.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.620
Study for OS final.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.220
Let's see, next Wednesday the 13th.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.800
I should probably make a plan for this because "studying" is kind of vague.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.540
Oh, they already have one for studying? I guess I'll use that then.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.420
Awesome! I just finished going over my notes, so I can take that one off of the list.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.620
Oh, it looks like I made enough progress. I guess I can just do the rest tomorrow then.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:50.260
Is there anything else that I had to do? Oh, I guess I should call my mom then.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.000
Hi mom. I'm doing great.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520
Yeah, I feel like I'm actually getting stuff done lately.
